## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I'm a senior math major at Carleton College with a passion for software development and mathematics.

My interest for these fields derive from excitement for...

- Organizing a theory into its constituent parts while investigating dependencies between these parts.
    - Using clean logical syntax to make organizational (i.e. algebraic) statements.
- Generalizing intuitions about space and motion into beautiful general theories. 

The "beautiful general theories" from the second bullet point are to me synonomyous with the field of [*differential geometry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), especially the topic of *differential forms*. I have written a textbook which develops the theory of differential forms and applies them to problems in computer graphics.


I written a textbook about differential geometry

- the generalized Stokes' theorem in particular- in mind here. I have written a [textbook](https://github.com/rossgk2/tensors__differential_forms__computer_graphics) which 

, I enjoy programming and software development for the ability they give me to see abstract ideas from math or physics come to life. I feel that doing quality OOP programming draws on the same thinking as abstract mathematics, and really enjoy OOP for this reason. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rossgk2/home/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rossgk2/home/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
