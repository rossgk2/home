## Ross Grogan-Kaylor

I'm a senior math major at Carleton College, graduating in March 2021, with a passion for software development and mathematics.

My interest for these fields derive from excitement for...

- Organizing a theory (such as a program) into its constituent parts while investigating dependencies between these parts.
    - Using clean logical syntax to make organizational (i.e. algebraic) statements.
- Generalizing intuitions about space and motion into beautiful general theories. 

The first bullet point encapsulates why I enjoy software development so much: software development is the *art* of organization. I especially like object oriented programming for the style of thinking it promotes.

The "beautiful general theories" from the second bullet point are to me synonomyous with the field of [*differential geometry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), especially the topic of *differential forms*. For my senior math thesis, I wrote a [textbook](https://github.com/rossgk2/tensors__differential_forms__computer_graphics) which develops the theory of differential forms and applies them to problems in computer graphics.

I am also a coauthor on two papers in hemodynamics (the dynamics of blood flow) in the heart:
- *False Lumen Ejection Fraction Predicts Growth in Type B Aortic Dissection: Preliminary Results*, European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery
- *4D Flow MRI Based Methods of False Lumen Pressure Estimation in Type B Aortic Dissection: Comparisons with Aortic Growth*, Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (in press)
