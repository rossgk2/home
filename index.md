## Ross Grogan-Kaylor

I am a 2021 graduate of Carleton College with a passion for software development and a B.A. in Mathematics.

My interest for software development and mathematics derives from excitement for...

- Organizing a theory (such as a program) into its constituent parts while investigating dependencies between these parts.
    - Using clean logical syntax to make organizational (i.e. algebraic) statements.
- Generalizing intuitions about space and motion into beautiful general theories. 

The first bullet point encapsulates why I enjoy software development so much: software development is the *art* of organization. I especially like object oriented programming, as it promotes a modular way of thinking.

The "beautiful general theories" from the second bullet point are to me synonomyous with the field of [*differential geometry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry), especially the topic of *differential forms*. For my senior math thesis, I wrote a [textbook](https://github.com/rossgk2/tensors__differential_forms__computer_graphics) which develops the theory of differential forms and applies them to problems in computer graphics.

I have also done some work in the field of biomechanics. From the summer of 2020 to the spring of 2021, I worked on [a program called "masks2Contours"](https://github.com/rossgk2/masks2Contours) for a joint research group between the University of Michigan and King's College London. I am a coauthor on two papers in hemodynamics (the dynamics of blood flow) in the heart:
- *False Lumen Ejection Fraction Predicts Growth in Type B Aortic Dissection: Preliminary Results*, European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery
- *4D Flow MRI Based Methods of False Lumen Pressure Estimation in Type B Aortic Dissection: Comparisons with Aortic Growth*, Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (in press)
